# How to contribute
While contributing there are 2 thing you need to do  
  1. **contribute:** Actually go into `nl_nl\locaizations.lua` and translate to your hearts content.
  2. **Log your progress:** Tell us in your commit description which lines you did, and log it in `progress.txt`, this file works by removing the lines you have done from the to-do list.

# Rules
  1. Do **not** use google translate unless you can compliment it with actual Dutch knoweledge.
  2. **Stay consistent**, look at similar words and make sure they're all translated the same.
  3. **Log your progress**, we need to know what you've done and what we still need to do.
